title: Gatsby's Governance Model
---

## Introduction

Gatsby is an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project supported by [Gatsby, Inc.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/) employees and an active community of contributors.

Our objectives for this document are to provide current information about the management and maintenance of Gatsby open source software (OSS) and present a variety of resources and avenues of communication between Gatsby’s leadership and community. It also includes a detailed description of contributor levels, code review process, pull request merge process and moderation. Furthermore, it outlines how you can get involved with Gatsby OSS. Establishing this governance models will help support active and productive communication/collaboration within the Gatsby community and between the community and the company.

**All community members must follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC)](/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/).** Consequences for CoC violations are detailed in [moderation](#moderation).

## Get involved

All contributions are welcome, including issues, contributing code, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, helping out people, and more. Read the [How to Contribute guide](/docs/contributing/#how-to-contribute) to learn what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## Decision-making process

TODO

Decisions about Gatsby open source software are ultimately made by Gatsby, Inc. leadership and the Core Team. We believe that founding organizations built around open source software have a responsibility to build strong businesses to sustain those open source tools and the community that depends on them, which will sometimes require us to reserve high-demand tools and features for Gatsby commercial products. That said, we take our responsibility to the community very seriously and carefully consider community needs and concerns when determining our product roadmaps.

_If you’d like to learn more about how we approach the relationship between our commercial and open source work, check out this blog post by Gatsby co-founder Sam Bhagwat: [Founding Organizations: Creating a Company That Sustains Our Open-Source Community](/blog/2020-02-11-founding-organizations/#reach-skip-nav)._

### Feature requests

### RFCs

## Moderation

Outlined below is the process for Code of Conduct violation reviews.

### Feature Requests

If you’d like to request or propose a Gatsby feature (or a change to an existing feature), the best way to start is to submit it as an issue via GitHub. The Core Team will then review your submission and decide whether or not to put it through our formal “Request for Comment” process.

### Community PR and Issue Review Process

Issues submitted by the community go through our Triage Process. You can learn more about this process in our [Triaging GitHub Issues doc](/contributing/triaging-github-issues/).

Our pull request review process is outlined in our [Managing Pull Requests doc](/contributing/managing-pull-requests/).

If you have any questions about an issue or PR, you can add a comment to the issue/PR on GitHub or reach out to us via one of the options in the "Engage with the Gatsby Team" section below.
