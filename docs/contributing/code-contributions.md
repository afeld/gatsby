title: Code Contributions

The beauty of contributing to open source is that you can clone your favorite project, get it running locally, and test out experiments and changes in real time! Way to feel like a wizard.

## Repository setup

This page includes details specific to the Gatsby core and ecosystem codebase.

To start setting up the Gatsby repo on your machine using git, yarn and `gatsby-cli`, check out the page on [setting up your local dev environment](/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/).

Alternatively, you can skip the local setup and [use an online dev environment](/contributing/using-an-online-dev-environment/).

To contribute to the blog, check out the setup steps on the [blog contributions](/contributing/blog-contributions/) page. For instructions on contributing to the docs, visit the [docs contributions page](/contributing/docs-contributions/).

## Creating your own plugins and loaders

If you create a loader or plugin, we would love for you to open source it and put it on npm. For more information on creating custom plugins, please see the documentation for [plugins](/docs/plugins/) and the [API specification](/docs/api-specification/).

## Contributing example sites

Gatsby's policy is that "Using" example sites (like those in the [examples part of the repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples)) should only be around plugins that are maintained by the core team as it's hard to keep things up to date otherwise.

To contribute example sites, it is recommended to create your own GitHub repo and link to it from your source plugin, etc.

## Development tools

### Debugging the build process

Check [Debugging the build process](/docs/debugging-the-build-process/) page to learn how to debug Gatsby.

## Official theme development

This section is for official theme development. If you are looking
to build your own theme, see [building themes](/docs/themes/building-themes/).

Themes live in their own [repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes). The themes themselves live in the `packages` directory and starters using them are in the `starters` directory. See the [repository README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/blob/master/README.md) to learn how to contribute.

## Feedback

At any point during the contributing process the Gatsby team would love to help! For help with a specific problem you can [open an issue on GitHub](/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/). Or drop in to [our Discord server](https://gatsby.dev/discord) for general community discussion and support.
