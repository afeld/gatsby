- **Becoming an expert.** You might start off totally new to a project like Gatsby or React.js, and by building things and [opening issues](/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/) when you encounter a new challenge or a bug, you'll learn a ton over time. Staying current with your favorite framework through its open source repo can also give you a leading edge on forthcoming changes.
